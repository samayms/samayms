## About Me
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Michigan (Class of 2029) with interests in software engineering, data science, and web technologies. I am building a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals while actively developing projects that demonstrate technical skills and problem-solving ability.

## Technical Skills
**Languages:** Python, C, C++

**Core Knowledge:** Data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, Linux/command line, Makefiles
**Areas of Interest:** Software engineering, full-stack web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, blockchain

## Projects
- **Credit Card Validator (C):** Implemented Luhnâ€™s algorithm to validate card issuers; strengthened debugging skills and algorithmic reasoning
- **Image Filters (C):** Developed grayscale, sepia, reflection, and Sobel edge detection filters for bitmap images using pointer arithmetic and memory management
- **Statistics Library (C++):** Designed functions for descriptive statistics and bootstrap resampling to enable accurate two-sample comparisons

*(See pinned repositories for code samples and documentation.)*

## Current Focus
- Advancing C++ proficiency through data structures and software design coursework.
- Strengthening algorithmic thinking and proof skills through discrete mathematics.
- Building side projects to apply classroom learning in practical contexts.

## Opportunities
I am seeking:
- Summer 2026 internships in software engineering, data science, technology, or related fields.
- Open-source collaboration opportunities.
- Mentorship from experienced engineers and researchers.
