# About Me
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Michigan (Class of 2029) with interests in software engineering, data science, consulting, and technology. As an enthusiastic undergraduate freshman, I am building a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals while actively developing projects that demonstrate technical skills and problem-solving ability.
# Current Learning Journey
As a freshman, I am actively expanding my knowledge in:
**Software Engineering** - Learning best practices, version control, and collaborative development
**Data Structures & Algorithms** - Strengthening problem-solving skills
**Programming Langauges** - Building profiency in C++ with an emphasis on efficiency and readability
**Quantum Computing** - Exploring fundamentals of quantum algorithms, qubits, and potential applications in cryptography and optimization
**Machine Learning & AI** - Beginning to explore algorithms and applications in predictive modeling
# Technical Skills
**Languages:** C, C++
**Core Knowledge:** Data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, Linux/command line, Makefiles
**Areas of Interest:** Software engineering, full-stack web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, blockchain
# What I'm Working On
- Building personal projects to apply classroom learning
- Exploring different areas of computer science to identify specialization areas
- Contributing to open source projects when possible
- Developing both technical and soft skills
# Projects
- **Credit Card Validator (C):** Implemented Luhn's algorithm to validate card issuers; strengthened debugging skills and algorithmic reasoning
- **Image Filters (C):** Developed grayscale, sepia, reflection, and Sobel edge detection filters for bitmap images using pointer arithmetic and memory management
- **Statistics Library (C++):** Designed functions for descriptive statistics and bootstrap resampling to enable accurate two-sample comparisons
# Professional Objectives
**For Recruiters and Potential Collaborators:** I am actively seeking internship opportunities, mentorship, and chances to contribute to meaningful projects. Please feel free to:
